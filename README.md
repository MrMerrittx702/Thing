# Thing FRQ

Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.
Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.
In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed  in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.
Consider the following Thing class. Each Thing object has a name attribute, which can be set in the constructor or by using the setName method. The name of a Thing object can be returned by the getName method.
